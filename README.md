# Metasploit-Deprecation-Key-Fixer-Script
A simple script to fix the error "W: http://downloads.metasploit.com/data...cid/InRelease: Key is stored in legacy trusted.gpg keyring (/etc/apt/trusted.gpg), see the DEPRECATION section in apt-key(8) for details."

the code was taken from here:https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/issues/16263#issuecomment-1063687165
I made a script from it to make a more user friendly thing than the single commands.
